\section{Download}

The latest GROOVE build can be downloaded from the GROOVE sourceforge page \url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/groove}.

The GROOVE library depends on some other libraties, namely:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0pt
\item Castor (XML only) (Version included: 0.9.9.1) \url{http://www.castor.org/}
\item JGraph Version included: 5.2.1 \url{http://www.jgraph.com/}
\item JGraphAddons Version included: 1.0.4
\item Xerces (xercesImpl) Version included 2.6.0
\item JUnit Version included: 3.8.1
\end{itemize}

There are some different distributions of the GROOVE tool set available on the sourceforge site. The \emph{groove-bin+lib} package includes all the libraries above. The \emph{groove-bin} package is identical but without the libraries. The \emph{groove_src} package only includes the sources of the groove project. There are also some examples available in the \emph{groove-samples} package. The \emph{groove-doc} package consists of some publications about GROOVE and the theory behind it. The \emph{format} package found under docs is now included in the usermanual, which is included in the binary releases.
