\section{Introduction}

This note is intended to introduce and explain the format used in the GROOVE
tool set (see \cite{Rens03d}) for editing and displaying graph production rules.

GROOVE (which stands for GRaphs for Object-Oriented VErification) eventually
intends to use graphs for expressing the semantics of object-oriented programs;
however, in its current relsease (Version 1.1, available for download at
\URL{\grooveURL}) the tool set only includes an editor for creating graph
production rules, a simulator for visually computing the graph transformations
induced by a set of graph production rules, a generator for automatically exploring state
spaces, and an imaging tool for converting graphs to images.
