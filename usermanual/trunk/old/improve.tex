\section{Improving GROOVE}

\subsection{Found a bug ?}

The web page of GROOVE proposes a bug tracker. Please do not hesitate to
report there the eventual bugs you find in the GROOVE tool. The developers
will treat these bug reports depending on their importance.

\subsection{Adding new features}

If you experience the need of having additional features in the GROOVE
tool, please let it know to the developers. The best way to do it would be
sending a mail; contact information can be found on the project web pages.
