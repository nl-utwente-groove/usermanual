The latest GROOVE build can be downloaded from the GROOVE sourceforge page 

\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/groove}. 

There are some different distributions of the GROOVE tool set available on the sourceforge site. The \emph{groove-bin+lib} package includes all the libraries above. The \emph{groove-bin} package is identical but without the libraries. The \emph{groove-src} package only includes the sources of the groove project. There are also some examples available in the \emph{groove-samples} package. The \emph{groove-doc} package consists of some publications about GROOVE and the theory behind it.
